### BUT WHY

Implemented to satisfy [an interesting ask on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/arkmodding/comments/yvcyvm/changingediting_wyvern_breath_attacks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3):
> Alright, so what im asking is pretty simple on paper, and i hope it really is something simple that can be done.. Simply put, Fire Wyverns are my favorite (Got and HotD fan) but i absolutely love the models and colors of the poison and lightning wyverms. So what i want to know, is if there is a way for me to replace the lightning and poison wyvern's breath attacks, with the Fire Wyvern's? (As well as their resistance to fire for fair reasons) If its possible, can someone tell me how to do it? (or do it for me, if its too much for me to handle)

I used only a slight variation of the suggestion commented there by [RedDwarf](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198018024432/myworkshopfiles/?appid=346110).

### BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE
- fertilized egg remaps
- zombie variant remaps

### WHY SPELL FIRE LIKE THAT?

I'm a weird fella.

### WHAT HAPPENS IF I DISABLE THIS MOD AFTER TRYING IT OUT?

All "fyred" dinos (wild and tamed) and eggs will go poof on restart.
